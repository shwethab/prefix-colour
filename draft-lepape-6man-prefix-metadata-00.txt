                  draft-lepape-6man-prefix-metadata-00

Abstract

   This document presents a method for applications to influence the
   IPv6 source selection algorithm used by the IP stack in a host.  To
   do so, IPv6 prefixes are associated with a meta-data when configured
   by the network.  The meta-data associated with the prefix allows the
   network to describe the purpose and propery of the prefix and the
   applications to make an intelligent decision for selecting the
   prefix.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 Prefix Meta-data and Usage           July 2013


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 provides not only a larger address space than IPv4, but the
   ability for host interfaces to have more than one IPv6 address of
   same or different scope.  When multiple prefixes are assigned to one
   or more network interfaces each of the multiple prefixes can have a
   specific property and purpose associated with it.  Example: In a
   mobile network a mobile device can be assigned a prefix from its home
   network and another from the visiting network that it is attached to.
   Another example is a prefix may provide free internet access while
   another prefix may be charged along with providing service level
   guarantees for network service access.  A prefix can have well
   defined properties that is universal and have a colour associated
   with it that communicates its local significance.  This additional
   information allows the host and applications to make more intelligent
   decisions about which source IPv6 address to select.

   This document introduces the meta-data to describe the prefix,
   motivation and considerations for delivering and using this meta-
   data.  The underlying assumption is that a endpoint or an application
   has multiple prefixes to choose from.  Typically this means either
   the endpoint has multiple interfaces or an interface has been
   configured with multiple prefixes.  This specification does not make
   a distinction between these alternatives.

1.1.  Motivation

   In this section motivation for meta-data attached to IPv6 prefix is
   described in the context of mobile networks and home networks.  The
   meta-data attached to a prefix helps to distinguish a IPv6 prefix and
   selection of the prefix by different applications using it.

1.1.1.  Home networks

   In a fixed network environment, the homenet CPE may also function as
   both a DHCPv6 client (requesting the IA_PD(s)) and a DHCPv6 server
   allocating prefixes from delegated prefix(es) to downstream home
   network hosts.  Some service providers may wish to delegate multiple
   prefixes to the CPE for use by different services classes and traffic
   types.

   Motivations for this include:

   o  Using source prefix to identify the service class / traffic type
      that is being transported.  The source prefix may then reliably be
      used as a parameter for differentiated services or other purposes.
      E.g.  [I-D.jiang-v6ops-semantic-prefix]




Le Pape, et al.         Expires January 12, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       IPv6 Prefix Meta-data and Usage           July 2013


   o  Using the specific source prefix as a host identifier for other
      services.  E.g. as an input parameter to a DHCPv4 over IPv6 server
      [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6]

   To meet these requirements, when the CPE (functioning as a DHCPv6
   server) receives an IA_NA or IA_TA request from a homenet host, a
   mechanism is required so that the correct prefix for requested
   service class can be selected for allocation.  Likewise for clients
   located in the homenet, a mechanism is necessary so that the intended
   service class for a requested prefix can be signalled and obtained
   either via DHCPv6 or SLAAC ( [RFC4862]).

1.1.2.  Mobile networks

   A mobile node in mobile network architecture can be associated with
   multiple IPv6 prefixes belonging to different domains for e.g. home
   address prefix, care of address prefix as specified in [RFC3775].
   The delegated prefixes may be topologically local and some may be
   remote prefixes anchored on a global anchor, but available to the
   local anchor by means of tunnel setup in the network between the
   local and global anchor.  Some may be local with low latency
   characteristics suitable for voice call break-out, some may have
   global mobility support.  So, the prefixes have different properties
   and it is required for the application using the prefix to learn
   about this property in order to use it intelligently.  Example to
   determine if the prefix is a home address or care of address or
   network characteristics that can be offered.


2.  Overview

   Figure 1 illustrates a typical network with different components that
   can add, understand and use the meta-data attached to a prefix.

   o  Mobile or ISP Network - Provisioned with prefixes that offer
      specific network characteristic. e.g. prefixes that do not have
      internet reach but can offer quality of service required for
      better video application experience.  Includes address delegation
      server that associate prefixes with this information, selects and
      offers this information during prefix delegation

   o  Home/Mobile gateway - Learns or determines characteristic of the
      prefix and propogates it along with prefix delegation. e.g.
      determines if the prefix is locally anchored or learns the prefix
      meta-data from the ISP prefix delegation server and includes this
      information in prefix delegation to endpoints

Internet-Draft       IPv6 Prefix Meta-data and Usage           July 2013


   o  Endpoint network stack - Learns the additional information
      associated with the prefix and offers interface to applications
      for listing and selecting the available prefixes

   o  Prefix selection policy - Either embedded in the application/
      endpoint or learnt from a server that helps choose the prefix with
      specific charateristic for the application based on predetermined
      service agreement between the application/endpoint/application
      service provider and network service provider

   o  Applications - That can utilize the prefix with specific
      characteristic for enhanced application user experience e.g. on
      demand video application, by choosing the prefix with appropriate
      prefix selection policy while connecting and delivering the
      application over the network

   The prefix meta data consists of following attributes:

   o  Prefix property - Well defined universally understood information
      about the prefix e.g. whether a prefix can provide internet
      reachablility, if the prefix offers application specific internet
      service level, if the prefix usage is free/charged, if the prefix
      offers security guarantees etc.  This is maintained as a global
      regitry as defined in Section 4.1.

   o  Prefix colour - conveys information of the prefix that is of
      relevance to the network where the prefix is provisioned and
      application using it e.g prefix that is provisioned to offer
      better video application experience.  The prefix colour is defined
      as a 16 bit numerical value to express this information.

   This meta-data can be further extended to have more attributes e.g.
   administrative domain of the prefix.

3.  Considerations

3.1.  Prefix meta-data propogation

   The prefix meta-data can be delivered using DHCPv6 prefix delegation
   and address allocation as ellaborated in
   [I-D.bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix] or via IPv6 Neighbour discovery
   (ND) as defined in [I-D.korhonen-6man-prefix-properties].

3.2.  Configuring applications

   Applications supporting multiple prefixes obtain the prefixes from
   the host kernel along with their meta-data.

   The policy can then be contained either locally (e.g. if the
   application is intended only for use within a specific network,
   linked to a particular ISP comes prepackages with prefix colour to
   use), or be contained on a distant server.  The mechanism used to
   exchange the meta-data information and selection between application/
   host with a distant server is beyond the scope of this document.

3.3.  Application to network stack communication

   Once an application has determined the appropriate property and
   colour for its use it has to communicate with the network stack to



Le Pape, et al.         Expires January 12, 2014                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       IPv6 Prefix Meta-data and Usage           July 2013


   select the prefix.  The host internal data structures need to be
   extended with the 'prefix property' and the 'prefix colour'
   information associated to the learnt prefix and configured addresses.
   How this is accomplished is host implementation specific.  It is also
   a host implementation issue how an application can learn or query
   both properties and colour of an address or a prefix.  One
   possibility is to provide such information through the socket API
   extensions.  Other possibilities include the use of e.g., ioctl() or
   NetLink [RFC3549] extensions or by using the IPv6 address scope
   [RFC4007].

3.4.  Default Address Selection

   The 'prefix property' leant by the network stack is only used as a
   hint.  It does not affect the existing [RFC6724] automatically.  A
   specific rule to host's policy table has to be inserted by an
   application or some daemon process.  Alternatively, an application
   can express its address property preferences through the socket API
   extensions which means the socket library or middleware has to modify
   [RFC6724] policy table or algorithm.  The 'prefix properties' flags
   MAY define the prefix preference for an IP stack that understands the
   extensions defined in this specification.  The IP stack SHOULD use
   the properties preferences to supersede [RFC6724] Source Address
   Selection Rule 8 when selecting a default source address among
   multiple choices and an application has not explicitly indicate what
   kind of source address it prefers.  As the 'prefix colour' is of
   significance to the application colour selection needs to be driven
   by the application and hence no default colour based address
   selection is required.

3.5.  Scope of Prefix Colour

   Since a home can be connected to multiple ISPs, it is possible that
   it receives multiple prefixes with the same colour from different
   ISPs.  Since the application colouring policy is not received with
   the colour, multiple ISPs could use different colouring policy for a
   colour.  Example One ISP could use colour 50 for video, while colour
   50 would be for audio for another ISP.

   This section presents some alternatives to handle this problem.

3.5.1.  Local scoping

   A locally scoped colour is a value which is selected by the network
   and application providers with no central registry.  In a multihomed
   network, this may result in two providers selecting the same colour
   for different behaviors.  A colour translation could be performed to
   ensure unique colour at the device that connects to multiple

Internet-Draft       IPv6 Prefix Meta-data and Usage           July 2013


   providers.

3.5.2.  Local scoping with fuzzy matching

   To avoid having to maintain multiple colours for each prefix for
   translating the colour, a specific algorithm can be used to determine
   the new colour from the old one on conflict.

   For example, when a collision is detected, the new colour value may
   be incremented.  Further, colours could be defined to be equally
   spaced (e.g., 10s or 100s).

   Many other encodings are possible as well, as long as obtaining the
   original colour communicated by the ISP may be recovered in the event
   the application policy server requires this.

3.5.3.  Global scoping

   A globally scoped colour avoids the need for responding to
   collisions.  This can be acheived by disambiguating the colour by
   attaching the domain that provisions the colour to the prefix meta-
   data or by assigning colours from a global registry that comes with
   the overhead of maintaining such a registry.


4.  IANA Considerations

   Should the global scoping for prefix colour be chosen, a new registry
   should be created by IANA to store colours.

4.1.  Prefix property values

   IANA is requested to reserve and maintain registry of prefix property
   values and manage allocation of values as per policy defined in
   [RFC5226] with IETF assigned values requiring IETF consensus, RFC
   Required policy, any other values other than the ones listed below
   are not valid.

   1.   0x0001 The prefix cannot be used to reach the Internet

   2.   0x0002 The prefix provides network based mobility

   3.   0x0004 The prefix requires authentication

   4.   0x0008 The prefix is assigned on an interface that provides
        security guarantees

Appendix A.  Prototype notes

A.1.  Homenet prototype implementation notes

   This section provides implementation details of a prototype developed
   for a video application on Android for a Galaxy Nexus device for home
   network.

A.1.1.  Video provider service

   A possible use of this prefix colouring is a video service, which
   requires the network to guarantee a minimal throughput to stream
   video.  A prefix could be coloured by the ISP to maintain a certain
   service level.  Using prefix colouring avoids having to set up a
   separate network for this usage.

   An agreement could then be established between the video service and
   the ISP, telling the video provider to use this specific colour (for
   example 50) when streaming video.

A.1.2.  Prefix Colour delegation

   The CPE routers request prefixes using prefix delegation [RFC3633]
   with the OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS option
   [I-D.bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix].  This informs the upstream
   provider that the CPE supports coloured prefixes.  If an ISP does not
   support this option, it will be ignored, and the CPE will only get
   colourless prefixes.  Otherwise, the ISP returns multiple prefixes
   each with their associated colour.  A colour of 0 is identical to an
   uncoloured prefix, for application compatibility, as explained in
   Appendix A.1.5.  If the CPE does not support coloured prefixes, the
   ISP could decide to delegate a normally coloured prefix as an
   colourless one, though this means hosts will use this prefix
   according to the default source address selection algorithm, and will
   not associate any meaning to it.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 Prefix Meta-data and Usage           July 2013


   Once the CPE receives those prefixes, it distributes them, along with
   their colour, using OSPF and the homenet protocols.
   [I-D.troan-homenet-sadr] defines "Source Address Dependent Routing"
   (SADR) which ensures that packets are routed based on their
   destination as well as source address.  SADR is necessary to ensure
   that a multihomed network using provider aggregatable addresses will
   send the packet out the right path to avoid violating the provider's
   ingress filtering.To ensure that those prefixes keep their meaning,
   Source Address Dependent Routing [I-D.troan-homenet-sadr] is
   implemented and used.

   Coloured addresses are advertised to hosts through DHCPv6, to
   associate the colour to the address.  Colourless addresses may be
   distributed through DHCPv6 or through Router Advertisements.  Hosts
   supporting coloured prefixes include the OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS, and
   receive coloured addresses.  For legacy hosts, who do not include
   this option, there are two possibilities :

   o  Those hosts can receive all available prefixes, including coloured
      ones, as uncoloured.  This allows a legacy host in a fully
      coloured homenet to still have access to IPv6.  However, those
      hosts may use prefixes for the wrong purposes.

   o  Those hosts can receive only colourless prefixes. this ensures
      that a prefix will not be used for the wrong purpose.  However,
      hosts in a fully coloured environment will not get access to IPv6.
      This can however be what the ISP originally intended, for example
      if the ISP does not provide access to the IPv6 internet, but uses
      IPv6 for wall gardened services, which their specific devices know
      how to use.

A.1.3.  Configuring applications

   Applications supporting multiple prefixes obtain the prefixes from
   the host kernel, along with their colour.

   The policy can be contained either in a local database (e.g. if the
   application is intended only for use within a specific network,
   linked to a particular ISP), or be contained on a distant server.

   For applications that do not contain a local database, an HTTP POST
   request is sent to a predefined server using a colourless prefix.
   This server, through means that are out of the scope of this
   document, selects the most appropriate colour for the URIs used by
   the application.  It then returns an XML document containing the
   mapping between the URIs and the colours.  URIs in this document MAY
   use wildcards.

Internet-Draft       IPv6 Prefix Meta-data and Usage           July 2013


   When the application is started, it sends the available prefixes and
   their colour to the video provider server which answers with a
   wildcard URI videos.example.com associated to colour 50.  In this
   example application it receives:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <mappings>
       <mapping>
           <URI>*://audio.example.com/*</URI>
           <colour>40</colour>
       </mapping>
       <mapping>
           <URI>rtsp://video.example.com/*</URI>
           <colour>50</colour>
       </mapping>
   </mappings>

   The server is expected to know the application, and thus to list all
   URIs that could be of use to the application.  The application will
   not ask the server if it has to contact an address not in the list
   and will use the colourless prefix.  This avoids an additional delay
   when trying to contact an unlisted URI.

   Example: While the application is browsing the video list, it is
   using www.example.com, and thus the colourless prefix.  However as
   soon as a video is choosen, it starts streaming from
   videos.example.com, and asks to connect to host videos.example.com
   with colour 50, indicating that it wishes to use the coloured prefix.

A.1.4.  Android DHCPv6

   Considering that this prototype is being implemented on Android, the
   first step is to get a running DHCPv6 client on Android, with support
   for the OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS option.

   The odhcp6c client, which already supports OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS, has
   been ported to Android, and is set to run in parallel to the dhcpcd
   client used for DHCP.  The success of any of the two clients results
   in the success of the WiFi connection, so as to support IPv6 only
   networks.

   This client configures the IPv6 addresses using calls to ip address,
   which is modified to support the addition of a class option to set
   the prefix colour.

A.1.5.  Application to network stack communication

   Once an application has received the appropriate colour for its use,
   in this prototype it specifies the prefix it wishes to use by using
   the IPv6 address scope [RFC4007].  When resolving this address, the
   standard library then adds this information in the address
   information it returns, using the scope field, allowing the kernel to
   appropriately select the source IP when connecting.  For this reason,
   a colour of 0 is identical to an colourless prefix.

   In the example, when downloading from video.example.com, the
   application would request a connection to video.example.com%50.

   This allows the user to override the application's default simply by
   specifying a colour in the scope of the URI it is trying to access,
   and requires little to no change in applications to support it.
   Applications that allow scope ids do not need to be modified in order
   to allow the user to use multiple prefixes (though it is then up to
   the user to select its colour).  A web browser that allows scope id
   would allow the user to add a colour to the URI, without requiring
   any modifications.

A.1.6.  Android kernel

   To reduce the amount of modifications needed by the applications to
   support this prefix colouring, we need to avoid having to bind to the
   address in the coloured prefix before initiating the connection.  The
   kernel is expected to choose the correct source address when a
   coloured destination is used.

   This implies storing the colour in the kernel, along with the
   address, which is done using a new attribute IFA_COLOUR to the
   netlink message RTM_NEWADDR, used by ip address.  Setting a coloured
   prefix using ioctls is not supported.

   Since colours are put in the scope id part of the destination
   address, we continue to use the scope element of the sockaddr_in6
   structure to store the colour when sending connect messages to the
   kernel.  The scope is only used when considering local addresses, so
   we interpret the presence of a scope on a non link-local address to
   be a colour.  Colours can not be assigned to link-local addresses,
   but since they are on the same link, source address shouldn't impact
   how the network treats packets.  When selecting the source address,
   we then discard all addresses which do not have the correct colour.

A.1.7.  Limitations of the current prototype

   It does not implement any duplicate colour detection.  Colours are
   considered to be unique within the home, and to correspond to the
   original colour provided by the ISP.  This is compatible with Global
   scoping.  No changes would be required to the host in order to
   support Local scoping with fuzzy matching, but OSPF would need to
   detect collisions, and the server would need to recalculate the
   original colour before making a decision.  In this implementation,
   hosts that do not support colours do not receive coloured prefixes.
